title: Estimating individual-level optimal causal interventions combining causal models
  and machine learning models
abstract: We introduce a new statistical causal inference method to estimate individual-level
  optimal causal intervention, that is, to which value we should set the value of
  a certain variable of an individual to obtain a desired value of another variable.
  This is defined as an optimization problem to minimize the error between a desired
  value and the value that would have been attained under the setting for the individual.
  To solve the optimization problem, we first train a machine learning model to predict
  the value of an objective variable and then estimate the causal structure of variables.
  We then combine the machine learning model and causal structure into a single causal
  model to estimate counterfactual value of the predicted objective variable. This
  is effective in achieving a more accurate estimation of individual-level optimal
  causal intervention. We further propose a gradient descent algorithm to compute
  the optimal causal intervention. Our method is generally applicable to continuous
  variables that are linearly and non-linearly related. In experiments, we evaluate
  the effectiveness of our method using artificial data generated by non-linear causal
  structures and real data.
