title: 'Dirac Delta Regression: Conditional Density Estimation with Clinical Trials'
abstract: Personalized medicine seeks to identify the causal effect of treatment for
  a particular patient as opposed to a clinical population at large. Most investigators
  estimate such personalized treatment effects by regressing the outcome of a randomized
  clinical trial (RCT) on patient covariates. The realized value of the outcome may
  however lie far from the conditional expectation. We therefore introduce a method
  called Dirac Delta Regression (DDR) that estimates the entire conditional density
  from RCT data in order to visualize the probabilities across all possible outcome
  values. DDR transforms the outcome into a set of asymptotically Dirac delta distributions
  and then estimates the density using non-linear regression. The algorithm can identify
  significant differences in patient-specific outcomes even when no population level
  effect exists. Moreover, DDR outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in conditional
  density estimation by a large margin even in the small sample regime. An R package
  is available at https://github.com/ericstrobl/DDR.
