title: 'Interactive Causal Structure Discovery in Earth System Sciences '
abstract: Causal structure discovery (CSD) models are making inroads into several
  domains, including Earth system sciences. Their widespread adaptation is however
  hampered by the fact that the resulting models often do not take into account the
  domain knowledge of the experts and that it is often necessary to modify the resulting
  models iteratively. We present a workflow that is required to take this knowledge
  into account and to apply CSD algorithms in Earth system sciences. At the same time,
  we describe open research questions that still need to be addressed. We present
  a way to interactively modify the outputs of the CSD algorithms and argue that the
  user interaction can be modelled as a greedy finding of the local maximum-a-posteriori
  solution of the likelihood function, which is composed of the likelihood of the
  causal model and the prior distribution representing the knowledge of the expert
  user. We use a real-world data set for examples constructed in collaboration with
  our co-authors, who are the domain area experts. We show that finding maximally
  usable causal models in the Earth system sciences or other similar domains is a
  difficult task which contains many interesting open research questions. We argue
  that taking the domain knowledge into account has a substantial effect on the final
  causal models discovered.
